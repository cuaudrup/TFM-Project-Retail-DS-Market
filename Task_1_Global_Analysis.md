# Task 1: Global Analysis.
Initially we received three tables with separate information:
- File 1. daily_calendar_with_events.csv. This table in .csv format contains date and time information.
- File 2. item_prices. This table in .csv format contains information about the prices of each product in each store for each week of the year.
- File 3. item_sales.csv. This table contains information on the number of products sold per day in each store.

The first step is to create a single table with the sales, prices and date information. Finally, we are left with a table of 58327370 recorded in a single table.

The next step is to export this data as a .csv file and load it into PowerBI to begin our data analysis and business understanding. Dividing our analysis into the following parts:
- GLobal vision.
- Vision by category.
- Vision by department.
- Vision by region.
- Vision by store.

## Global Vision:
We created a first dashboard with all the data that allows us to understand the business data from a global perspective. For the first KPIs regarding the company's sales trends, we took 2015 as a benchmark and compared it to the previous year to gain the following insights.
- As KPIs we have different insights:
  - Sales with $52.32m and the comparison with the previous year of $46.58m (+12.33%).
  - Items sold with 13.8 M, and its comparison with the previous year at 13.09 M (+5.43%).
  - Average sale per item with 3.79 $, and its comparison with the previous year at 3.56 $ (+6.55%).
  - Sales per day with 143,349 $, and its comparison with the previous year at 127,611 M$ (+12.33%).
