# Store Supply and API.
To carry out store replenishment, we will use the forecasts created with our time series model combined with an EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) model. This approach aims to achieve the best stock adjustment for each product in each store, i.e., for each ID. In the project notebook, all the coding details can be seen. For our stock, we will create the dataframe 'df_stock.'

The EOQ model is a widely used tool for inventory control and store replenishment. This model allows us to optimize both the order size and the safety stock that we should maintain in each of our stores based on each ID. In fact, this model is very useful for handling products with high variability in sales, ranging from items that sell infrequently to those sold regularly.

To apply the formulas on which this model is based, we need certain variables, which include:

Calculation of average sales (D): in our case, this will be the value of the 'df_stock['n_sales']' column, which contains the values provided by our time series model.
Standard deviation of product demand (Ïƒ): a new column created afterward showing this deviation, 'df_stock['std_deviation']'.
Cost of placing an order (S): a column expressing the cost of placing an order for each product. In our case, we chose 10% of the 'sell_price,' although the logistics team could provide a more precise estimate. This variable will be 'df_stock['sell_price'] * 0.10'.
Cost of holding a product (H): this variable represents the cost to the company of holding a product in stock; we chose 5%. Like the S variable, logistics could adjust this value. This variable corresponds to 'df_stock['sell_price'] * 0.05'.
Once we have these variables, the model will provide three values to supply our stores using the formulas detailed in the notebook. These are:

Economic Order Quantity (EOQ): the number of units that should be ordered per request.
Safety Stock (SS): this provides the inventory buffer quantity to mitigate demand deviations. This means extra stock to handle potential changes in demand or supply issues from vendors.
Reorder Point (ROP): represents the inventory level at which a new order should be placed to restock before depletion. This value will indicate when it is necessary to replenish the product and will thus be considered the minimum required stock.
It should be noted that this replenishment model can be adjusted based on the products in stock; for instance, formulas could be adjusted for more perishable items or those with very high demand. Additionally, products with a minimum stock level of 0 can be sold on-demand to customers.

Finally, our final stock dataframe is structured as follows.

| | id   | week | n_sales | n_sold_products | stock_extra | stock_required |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
|0| ACCESORIES_1_00 1_BOS_1  | 17  | 3  | 7  | 1  | 4  |
|1| ACCESORIES_1_00 1_BOS_2  | 17  | 4  | 8  | 1  | 5 |
|2| ACCESORIES_1_00 1_BOS_3  | 17  | 4  | 8 | 1  | 5  |
|3| ACCESORIES_1_00 1_NYC_1  | 17  | 7  | 10  | 2 | 8  |
|4| ACCESORIES_1_00 1_NYC_2  | 17  | 7  | 10  | 2  | 8  |
