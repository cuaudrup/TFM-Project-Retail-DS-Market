# TFM-Project-Retail-DS-Market
This is my TFM Retail project. In this project, I have done a deep analysis of the business with a long database of almost 5 years of sales to extract important insights. For this project, I used two Machine Learning models, one of Clustering for product classification and the other of Time Series to predict sales.
